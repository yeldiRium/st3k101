`backend` Container Documentation
=

This directory contains tools for generating the documentation for the `backend`
container. The documentation is built using sphinx.

## How to build

Following these steps will generate a html documentation of the `backend` 
container in `backend/doc/build`. It is important to run all of the commands
described here from the `backend/doc` directory.

### Setup

First, use the `setup.sh` script to create a virtual environment and then 
install sphinx and other requirements into it. Simply run:

```bash
backend/doc $  ./setup.sh
```
Follow the instructions.
Messages generated during setup are written to `setup.log`.
You only need to run the setup once.

### Build

Be sure to do the setup first, building won't work otherwise.
To build the documentation, run:

```bash
backend/doc $  ./build.sh
```

The documentation will be written to `backend/doc/build`, you may access it by
opening `backend/doc/build/index.html`. Messages and warning generated by sphinx
during the build are written to `build.log`.
