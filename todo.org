** What to do about DataSubject Accounts of the same person that were created from different sources (LTI/Standalone)

   | Data               | Standalone Registration | LTI Registration |
   |--------------------+-------------------------+------------------|
   | lti_user_id        | No                      | Yes              |
   | email              | Yes                     | Maybe            |
   | person_name_full   | No                      | Maybe            |
   | person_name_given  | No                      | Maybe            |
   | person_name_family | No                      | Maybe            |

   None of the data that is always present -> same person using LTI and Standalone
   may have 2 DataSubject Accounts

   Should we merge those 2 Acocunts at some point?
   Consider following case:

   DataSubject A completes Survey with email address B
   DataSubject A completes Survey via LTI with email address B
   => Accounts are merged at some point
   DataSubject A completes Survey via LTi with email address C
   => DataSubject A's email address is updated to email address C
   DataSubject A wants to use email address B for authenticating
   => DataSubject A is rejected, because their email address was updated silently

   Therefore we should not try to merge these user Accounts.
** Should survey be reachable in standalone mode when embedding is activated?
   Toggle standalone and embedded availability seperately
