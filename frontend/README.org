* ST3K101 Frontend Container
** Development Setup
   Requires:
   - node.js >=9
   - a running and reachable ST3K101-backend container

   Install dependencies locally.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm install
   #+END_SRC

   Build docker container.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     docker-compose build
   #+END_SRC

   Serve at localhost:80.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     docker-compose up frontend
   #+END_SRC

   If you want to rebuild every time you change something, run
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run dev
   #+END_SRC
   locally. This will watch the project and rebuild on change.
   However, you still have to reload the browser every time.
** Building
   =docker_registry= must be of the form =hostname[:port]=. If none is
   supplied, docker hub is assumed.

   Build the container.
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ./../build.sh build <docker_registry>
    #+END_SRC

    Run tests (currently none).
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ./../build.sh test
    #+END_SRC

    Publish the container to docker registry.
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ./../build.sh publish <docker_registry>
    #+END_SRC

    Or you can do all of the above in one step.
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ./../build.sh run <docker_registry>
    #+END_SRC
** Configuration
*** Environment
    - NODE_ENV
      Tells node, whether it is running in =development=, =testing= or
      =production= mode.
