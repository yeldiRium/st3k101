## What is this?

The xAPI-Probe (codename st3k101) is a survey tool targeting applications in
the social sciences. It uses [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) for data exchange and has a [RESTful API](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13EFtQKvSF-8WMNoXMkEk4OJLZ729bAe6Iqd_6bnintI/edit?usp=sharing).

The tool is realized as a full-stack web application, featuring a reactive
frontend written in VueJS. It was originally developed as part of a seminar
work by @yeldiRium and @strangedev, but has since been heavily modified. The
survey tool backend was the topic of @strangedev's bachelor thesis, which can
be found [here](https://github.com/strangedev/bachelor-thesis/blob/master/ba.pdf).

## Project Structure

The project is divided into different services, which can be found in the 
identically named directories:

- frontend
- backend
- xapi-publisher

Each of these services provides their own README, outlining the most important
information about the service, as well as information on how to set up a
development environment for working on the service.
